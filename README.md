This branch is not a crook.

Cheating scandals suck. It would be helpful if there existed a watermark  attached to the XML of Snap! project files that kept track of various attributes about the history of a given file. These may include:

- Date and time created
- List of authors
- Whether the project is a remix or not

Furthermore, to thwart pesky XML modifiers, it would be neat to implement a check that will refuse to open a Snap! file if the list of authors or timestamps is modified.

Have a nice day!
